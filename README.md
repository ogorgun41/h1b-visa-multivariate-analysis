# H-1B Multivariate Data Analysis (2021–2024)

This project analyzes multivariate trends in H-1B visa applications from FY2021 to FY2024 using real-world datasets
Multivariate analysis of H-1B visa applicants from FY2021–FY2024 is conducted
It explores patterns in demographics, job titles, wages, visa classes, and processing outcomes using Python-based data science workflows and Tableau's storytelling

---

## Objectives

- Analyzing gender distribution across countries and visa stages
- Visualizing average age by job title and gender
- Mapping average wages by U.S. state and employer
- Identifying top employers and job titles by approvals
- Exploring field of study trends vs. education level
- Predicting and correcting wage formats (annually/monthly/weekly)
- Analyzing processing delays across visa classes and outcomes
